**CF7 Submission Limit Extension**

The functionality of email validation to prevent duplicates has been added to the PHP function Form submission limit validation.

You just need to replace the Frontend.php file within the directory: `wp-content > plugins > cf7-form-submission-limit-wpappsdev > includes > Frontend.php`. 

In addition to this modification, you need to have the CFDB7 plugin installed, which creates a database used for email field validation.
